# Wacom Loader

This program is written to load/unload the faulty [linuxwacom/input-wacom](https://github.com/linuxwacom/input-wacom) kernel module dynamically with the intention of using it with built-in shortcuts feature that comes in many modern desktop environments (DEs)

## Installation

To install this program, run in a terminal:

```
./build.sh install
```

The proper privileges the program requires are automatically set. It is up to the user to hook it up with their DEs' shortcut system.
